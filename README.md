# Christmas Breakout

**Christmas Breakout** is an independent edition of the famous Atari Breakout. In the game, there is a wall of blocks that the player needs to destroy using a ball. The ball travels across the gamespace, and the player controls a movable paddle to prevent the ball from falling through the bottom of the screen (i.e. losing it).
