# Christmas Breakout

**Christmas Breakout** is an independent edition of the famous Atari Breakout. In the game, there is a layer of blocks (candies) that the player needs to destroy using a ball. The latter travels across the gamespace, so the player has a movable paddle to prevent losing it if the ball touches the bottom of the screen.
